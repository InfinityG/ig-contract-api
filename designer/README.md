notes:
------

suystem starts with the initialization service, service initializes user session, token etc. context hard-coded
mock mode is set, initialiseMocks is run to create a mocj context
routes living in app.js
templates are saving, but contracts are not - copy template saving pattern

tempateDesignerController
	modelIndexService - flattens object trees, quickly accesable in memory by a key instead of local storage
